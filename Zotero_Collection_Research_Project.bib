  abstract = {The South Caucasus was a major center of metal production in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. Nowhere is this more clear than in the hills and mountains in the southeastern Black Sea region (ancient Colchis), where exceptionally large numbers of metal production sites have been found. Chemical and microscopic analysis of slagged technical ceramics at these sites illuminates several aspects of both raw copper and tin bronze alloy production. Copper ores were smelted in a complex multi-stage process designed to extract metal from sulfide ores. Technical ceramics served as containers for a range of different reactions, from the first phase of smelting, in which the copper sulfides were likely consolidated into a matte, though later stages of matte processing and metal copper production in smaller crucibles. In addition, a single crucible fragment, recovered from a late 2nd millennium BC slag heap, demonstrates that tin bronze was created by the direct addition of cassiterite tin ore, probably of alluvial origin, to metallic copper. The crucible's context, the use of cassiterite ore rather than tin metal, and a review of local geology suggests that the tin used in this crucible came from nearby, with the most likely source being the Vakijvari and Bzhuzhi gorges roughly 10\textendash{}15~km away. While a single fragment does not speak to the regularity of this practice, at the very least it raises the possibility that the Colchian bronze industry was based on local rather than imported tin.},

  abstract = {The Eastern Black Sea region of the South Caucasus contains an extremely rich record of metallurgical remains that is poorly known outside of the former Soviet Union. Large numbers of relatively small smelting sites dot the foothill regions, forming a dispersed, yet large-scale metallurgical landscape. New fieldwork in the region has followed up on earlier Soviet period research, relocating and reanalyzing previously known sites and identifying new ones. This paper presents a series of 33 radiocarbon (14C) dates from copper and iron smelting sites in this region. Dates from copper smelting sites suggest that copper smelting occurred over a shorter and more intense period than previously thought, between about 1300 and 800 BC. Dates from newly discovered iron smelting sites place these activities in two episodes during the Classical-Hellenistic period (ca. 500\textendash{}200 BC) and the High Medieval period (ca. AD 1050\textendash{}1400). The dramatic expansion in bronze production immediately prior to the adoption of iron mirrors patterns in other regions of Europe and the Near East, and has implications for understanding the economic contexts in which iron emerged. While the new dates from iron smelting sites provide only an initial outline of the iron production chronology in the region, they represent an important step for resolving outstanding issues from previous investigations.},

  abstract = {Studies of metal production frequently show a correlation between scale and organizational complexity. The remarkably rich landscapes of metal-producing sites of late 2nd-early 1st millennium BC Colchis provide an unprecedented opportunity to reexamine this apparent correlation. Investigations of copper smelting sites show that industries with a large aggregate output can be the result of numerous small groups of metalworkers acting independently. Spatial data on site distributions, estimates of productive output, and archaeometric data on ore procurement patterns were integrated to reconstruct the organization of production. Judicious use of a portable X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (pXRF) showed that not only were smelting sites highly dispersed, but also that metalworkers at different sites were using ores from geologically distinct deposits. This innovative approach helped to reconstruct the organization of production in a distinctive metal production landscape, bridging an enduring divide between landscape-scale and microscopic investigations of craft production.},

  abstract = {The hillforts of the Oxfordshire Ridgeway in south-central England have been interpreted as central places in the Early/Middle Iron Age, ca. 600\textendash{}100 BCE, serving, among other functions, to integrate the management of animals, particularly sheep, between the upland Chalk downs and the adjacent low-lying Vale of the White Horse. Since these landforms differ geologically and pedologically, they lead to distinct isotopic ratios in the biosphere and so present the potential to investigate animal management practices in some detail. Here, we report the results of a multi-isotope study on domestic fauna (cattle, sheep and pig) within a very constrained study area, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that the Ridgeway's hillforts were placed to control and coordinate the movement of sheep between the Chalk and the Vale. However, the results suggest a different scenario. Bone collagen {$\delta$}15N results indicate that cattle and sheep were both kept locally. Strontium isotopes, conversely, indicate that, while sheep and pigs were raised locally, cattle appear to have been mainly kept in the Vale during at least the first year of their lives. The apparent discrepancy between the two isotopes can be reconciled by the different periods of life represented by enamel and bone collagen measurements, with the movement of cattle onto the Ridgeway in their second or third year of life. Sequential measurements of {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N in dentine, and of {$\delta$}13Cc and {$\delta$}18Oc in enamel, provide further detail on the management of cattle, and offer some support for the above scenario. Early/Middle Iron Age stock-keeping in south-central England was complex, being integrated in some respects but distinct in others. The study demonstrates the level of detail it is possible to achieve with a multi-isotope approach to animal management practices in prehistory. The focus on a micro-region contrasts with, or rather complements, studies addressing larger-scale movement of animals in the past.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate livestock husbandry and its relationship to the mobilization of domestic animals for slaughter at large communal feasting events, in Late Neolithic Makriyalos, northern Greece. A multi-isotope approach is built that integrates analysis of: {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of human and animal bone collagen for understanding long-term dietary behavior, Incremental {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}18O values of domestic animal tooth enamel carbonate for assessing seasonal patterns in grazing habits and mobility, and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of cattle tooth enamel for examining the possibility that some of the animals consumed at the site were born outside the local environment. The findings indicate that cattle had isotopically more variable diets than sheep, which may reflect grazing over a wider catchment area in the local landscape. Cattle products did not make a significant contribution to the long-term dietary protein intake of the humans, which may indicate that they were primarily consumed during episodic feasting events. There is no indication that pasturing of livestock was pre-determined by their eventual context of slaughter (i.e. large-scale feasting vs. more routine consumption events). Two non-local cattle identified among those deposited in a feasting context may have been brought to the site as contributions to these feasts. The evidence presented provides a more detailed insight into local land use and into the role of livestock and feasting in forging social relationships within the regional human population.},

The aim was to investigate diet and mobility within the populations and across a range of animal species. The results demonstrate a significant level of mobility within the Iron Age, with around 20\% of the terrestrial herbivores either having been reared off the chalkland and brought to the sites from perhaps 150\textendash{}200 km away or moving between isotopically distinct areas throughout much of their life and presenting a `mixed' isotopic signal. The results lead us to suggest that the old paradigm that views most Iron Age people as leading relatively sedentary lives should be re-evaluated, and new models be considered that allow for regular movements by a portion of the population over much larger distances than hitherto considered in this period of prehistory.},

  issn = {0305-4403},
  abstract = {A pattern of seasonal mobility between the coast and the hinterland by Khoekhoe pastoralists in the south-western Cape of South Africa was documented at the time of European contact. Because the region is characterized by a mosaic of geological substrates of various ages and vegetation types with different proportions of C3 and C4 plants, this mobility model for prehistoric herders can be tested by analysis of carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope ratios in domestic bovid tooth enamel. Isotopic analysis was performed on archaeological sheep, cattle, eland and steenbok teeth from the Late Stone Age site of Kasteelberg on the Vredenburg Peninsula. Sequential sampling of enamel provided a chronological record of the isotopic composition of diet during tooth formation. Results from carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of archaeological and modern steenbok teeth show seasonal variation in the {$\delta$}13C of local pastures in the vicinity of the site (up to 2{$\cdot$}9\textperthousand{} in a single individual), which could be due to seasonal change in proportions of C3 and C4 plants and/or seasonal variation in the {$\delta$}13C of C3 plants. A pattern of seasonal change of 0{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}3{$\cdot$}5\textperthousand{} in the {$\delta$}13C of tooth enamel is also observed in the sheep teeth. This amplitude of variation could be due to local seasonal changes, thus it is not possible, from the {$\delta$}13C values, to infer whether the sheep were moving seasonally. Results from 87Sr/86Sr analysis of two sheep suggest that one individual stayed all year round on the coast, whereas the other had grazed in the interior for part of its life. Both {$\delta$}13C and 87Sr/86Sr values measured in a cow tooth suggest that this animal spent part of its life in the interior, even though it died at Kasteelberg. Results on this cow also suggest longer residence within habitats rather than seasonal mobility. A clear pattern of seasonal mobility between the coast and the interior has not been shown for prehistoric pastoralists. However, the pattern of mobility attested in historical times might have developed only later in prehistory, when cattle pastoralism developed in the region.},

  abstract = {The structure and geological history of the Caucasus are largely determined by its position between the stillconverging Eurasian and Africa-Arabian lithospheric plates, within a wide zone of continental collision. During the Late Proterozoic\textendash{}Early Cenozoic, the region belonged to the Tethys Ocean and its Eurasian and Africa-Arabian margins where there existed a system of island arcs, intra-arc rifts, back-arc basins characteristic of the pre-collisional stage of its evolution of the region. The region, along with other fragments that are now exposed in the Upper Precambrian\textendash{}Cambrian crystalline basement of the Alpine orogenic belt, was separated from western Gondwana during the Early Palaeozoic as a result of back-arc rifting above a south-dipping subduction zone. Continued rifting and seafloor spreading produced the Palaeotethys Ocean in the wake of northward migrating peri-Gondwanan terranes. The displacement of the Caucasian and other peri-Gondwanan terranes to the southern margin of Eurasia was completed by \textasciitilde{}350 Ma. Widespread emplacement of microcline granite plutons along the active continental margin of southern Eurasia during 330\textendash{}280 Ma occurred above a north-dipping Palaeotethyan subduction zone. However, Variscan and Eo-Cimmerian\textendash{}Early Alpine events did not lead to the complete closing of the Palaeozoic Ocean.

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an explosion of research projects in Southern Caucasia that apply the methodologies and approaches of landscape archaeology. Focused on understanding the interaction between humans and their environments at multiple temporal and geographic scales, these projects have made use of intensive and extensive surveys, remote sensing and GIS-based analysis, very often taking a diachronic view. Landscape Archaeology in Southern Caucasia presents and reflects on projects currently employing these fresh perspectives and techniques in the lands between the Black and Caspian Seas, including and adjacent to the Greater and Lesser Caucasus mountain ranges; this takes in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and parts of eastern Turkey and northwestern Iran. Through the centuries, this region has been a vital zone of contact between the Near East, Anatolia and Central Asia, but has also \textendash{} in large part due to its remarkable and often difficult terrain of mountains, river valleys and plains \textendash{} maintained a unique and fascinating local trajectory of development. Landscape Archaeology in Southern Caucasia is the product of a workshop held at the 10th ICAANE in Vienna in April 2016, which brought together scholars from around the world engaged in archaeological survey and landscape analysis in Southern Caucasia. The contributions in the volume cover a broad timescale, from the Neolithic through the medieval period and into the modern day, and deal with such themes as the relationship between past and present landscapes, heritage management, the use of remote sensing, the value of integrating historical texts and legacy data into new projects, survey methodologies, and patterns of movement. The volume also includes discussion of avenues for further research, particularly in the fields of information sharing and deeper engagement with legacy data. Finally, Landscape Archaeology in Southern Caucasia reflects and celebrates the spirit of collaboration between scholars within and beyond Southern Caucasia that is both apparent in the diversity of current projects and crucial to achieving the aims of future work in the region.},

However, research on the technological transformations of the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age suffers from a lack of investigation of primary metal production contexts, especially in regions outside the Levant. The current research examines metal production debris from a large number of smelting sites in western Georgia, and addresses questions of technology and resource utilization through detailed examination of few select sites. Through the chemical and mineralogical analysis of slag samples, we demonstrate the existence of an extensive copper-production industry and reconstruct several key aspects of the smelting technology during the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Combining a statistical analysis of slag mineralogy with other lines of evidence, we argue that copper was extracted from sulfide ores through a process of roasting and smelting in deep pit furnaces. The data also suggest that metalworkers at different sites exploited different ore sources within the same ore body. These results form a fundamental basis for further examination of spatial and chronological patterns of technological variation, with implications for models of Near Eastern copper production in this crucial period. Intriguing evidence of bloomery iron smelting, though currently undated, reinforces the region's potential to provide data on a key technological transformation.},

Radiogenic strontium and mass-dependent oxygen and carbon isotope analysis on a large sample of herd animals (sheep, goats, and cattle) from Late Bronze Age (1500\textendash{}1100 BC) sites in the Tsaghkahovit Plain, Armenia indicate that long-distance movements across geological zones were not common, but that animals were drinking from a range of water sources. Connecting this variation to movement is complicated by limited intra-tooth variation in {$\delta$}13C values. Data from the study provide preliminary evidence for foddering. These results reveal a gap between the emphasis on mobility in theoretical models of pastoralism and political organization and the way that animal diets mediate isotopic proxies for movement. These interpretive difficulties emphasize the need to consider herds' seasonal and geographic movement within a wider range of pastoralist practices. These findings also highlight the need for large sample sizes in isotopic investigations of pastoralist mobility, in order to accurately identify and evaluate the diversity in both geographic and seasonal movements within a single ancient pastoralist system.},

Despite frequent references in the literature to prehistoric pastoral nomads, pastoralism in Southwest Asia was strongly associated with sedentary communities that practiced intensive plant cultivation and was largely local in nature. There is very little evidence in prehistoric and early his-toric Southwest Asia to support the notion of a ``dimorphic society'' characterized by separate and specialized agriculturists and mobile pastoralists. Although mobile herders were present in the steppe regions of Syria by the early second millennium BC, mobile pastoralism was the exception rather than the rule at that time; its ``iden-tification'' in the archaeological record frequently derives from the application of anachronistic ethnographic analogy. We conclude that pastoralism was a diverse, flexible, and dynamic adaptation in the ancient Near East and call for a reinvigorated and empirically based archaeology of pastoralism in Southwest Asia.},

  volume = {575},
  abstract = {The stable hydrogen ({$\delta$}D) and oxygen ({$\delta$}18O) isotope composition of modern meteoric water are influenced by changes in global temperature, Rayleigh distillation processes, and moisture transport history. However, on a global scale the relative influence of these different meteorological variables is spatially heterogeneous. We collected daily precipitation samples from meteorological stations in the Armenian Highlands for a period of one year in order to determine the constraints on {$\delta$}D and {$\delta$}18O and relationship to broader climatic conditions. These data are coupled with HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis to determine how these compositions relate to moisture source and transport path. Multivariate analysis shows the strongest relationship between {$\delta$}D and {$\delta$}18O and climate variables is temperature at the sampling site. Along with temperature, the intensity of the North Atlantic Oscillation, a pattern of atmospheric circulation which determines the strength and location of Northern Hemisphere midlatitude westerlies, is significant (p {$<$} 0.05) for both {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}D values of precipitation. This correlation between NAO and isotopes in precipitation is also observed in four nearby GNIP stations from 2008 to 2015. Negative NAO phases are associated with weakened westerlies, which allows precipitation enriched in heavy isotopes from the Mediterranean and southerly sources to penetrate into the Armenian Highlands, whereas positive NAO phases are associated with stronger westerlies bringing more negative precipitation from the Black Sea. This relationship is most significant (p {$<$} 0.001) during the winter and spring months (December to May). These data demonstrate that paleo-archives of {$\delta$}D and {$\delta$}18O in the Armenian Highlands could serve as a tool to measure changes in the NAO in the past, particularly when coupled with independent measurements of temperature.},

  abstract = {Carbon and oxygen isotope measurements ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}18O) of bioapatite carbonate fractions in archaeological and fossil remains are essential tools to investigate past diets and climates. The reliability of these reconstructions is however dependent on the recovery of the biological signal and the removal of competing sources of carbon and oxygen isotopes, such as remaining organic material and secondary carbonates. Modern, archaeological and fossil bone and tooth specimens have been treated with different chemicals commonly used to pre-treat the samples with the aim of removing these competing sources of isotopes. Results highlight significant shifts in the isotope values of the samples tested, with different isotopic effects according to which pre-treatment was used. This has a clear impact on the data recovered, and may lead to misinterpretations of the results and inferred past diets and climates. The results of this study suggest that both hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite, the most commonly used oxidising agents employed to remove organic substance, have major problems: hydrogen peroxide is only partially efficient as organic removal agent and causes unwanted bioapatite dissolutions and isotopic shift, while sodium hypochlorite induces the incorporation of exogenous carbonates into the bioapatite, likely from the dissolution of atmospheric CO2 into the test tube. In both cases, there is an impact on the recovered isotope composition. Hydrazine hydrate, a third chemical for organic removal, has the lowest influence on the bioapatite isotopic composition, being also efficient at removing organic matter from bioapatites. The latter is recommended as an organic removal agent if such pre-treatment is deemed necessary. The use of acetic acid also causes isotopic shifts that seem independent on the removal of secondary/diagenetic carbonate, as also occurring in modern samples. Overall, our study clearly shows that any chemical treatment commonly used to remove unwanted contaminants from the bioapatite samples has also unpredictable, often significant effects on the pristine isotopic composition recovered, and corroborates the need for consistency in the pre-treatment of bone and teeth specimens. It also questions the necessity of removing organic matter at all from most skeletal samples prior to isotopic analysis.},

  abstract = {A large variety of bioapatite pre-treatments are found in the literature for a wide range of applications going from mineralogy to diagenesis. Additionally, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in bioapatite carbonates are often measured after pre-treatment to study ancient diets and reconstruct past environments. It is common to pre-treat the samples to remove contributions from competing sources associated to organic material and secondary carbonates. Several chemical methods are described in the literature to pre-treat archaeological and fossil bioapatites (bone and teeth) for isotopic measurements with no consistency on their efficiency. Infrared and elemental analyses are combined in this study to highlight the effects of the different pre-treatments on the structure and chemistry of bioapatite. The different pre-treatments can variably affect the organic and carbonate contents of bioapatites, with some, such as sodium hypochlorite, apparently adding carbonate to the system. This may lead to a change in the biological isotopic signature of bioapatite carbonate, with effects on the correct interpretation of the results. According to the findings of our study, hydrazine hydrate seems to be the best chemical to remove organic matter without affecting the carbonate content of bioapatites, while the use of acetate buffered acetic acid solutions is recommended for removing adsorbed carbonates, when necessary. Sodium hypochlorite, instead, induces the adsorption of exogenous carbonates, while hydrogen peroxide does not remove organic matter efficiently even at high temperatures. These two chemicals should not be used to remove organic matter, especially from bone and dentine.},

According to these studies, the period of youngest volcanic activity in the region lasted about 700 000 years, from 700 ka to a few tens of thousands of years ago. We found the time limits of five discrete phases of Quaternary volca nism: I (about 700 ka), II (550\textendash{}480 ka), III (190\textendash{}150 ka), IV (110\textendash{}70 ka), and V (later than 50 ka). These phases seem to have lasted a few tens of thousands of years and were separated by quiescent periods of com parable durations. The petrologic and isotope\textendash{}geochemical characteristics of Geghama effusive rocks show that they belong to the bimodal association rhyolite\textendash{}trachyandesite and basaltic trachyandesite; this association was largely gen erated by fractional crystallization of primary basite melts, with the assimilation of crustal material by deep magmas being much less important. The isotopic parameters of the volcanic rocks studied here (0.70410\textendash{}0.70437 for 87Sr/86Sr and +3.3 to +4.0 for \cyrchar\CYRIE{}Nd) are practically identical for intermediate to basic and acid varieties in this association and are similar to those for young basites in the other areas of the Lesser Caucasus; this circumstance indicates a common origin for all Quaternary magmatic formations in the region. The petrogenesis of these varieties probably involved a single mantle source of the OIB type with certain regional peculiarities in the composition of the melts it generated.},

Here, we explore the use of vertical transhumance in Anatolia during the Early and Middle Chalcolithic periods (6200\textendash{}4500~cal BC), a time of socio-political transformation that presaged the rise of early state level societies in the region supported by a pronounced intensification in the exploitation of domesticated sheep and goats for their wool \textendash{} a valuable commodity. We examine the carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and oxygen ({$\delta$}18O) composition of sequentially sampled tooth enamel from Chalcolithic sheep and goats from K{\"o}{\c s}k H{\"o}y{\"u}k. The pattern of inverse cyclical isotopic variation characterized by high summer season {$\delta$}18O values coincident with low {$\delta$}13C values suggests livestock were moved to moist, high elevation pastures supporting 13C-depleted graze during the summer months or supplied with 13C-enriched fodder during the winter months. Inter-individual variation in absolute {$\delta$}18O values and the amplitude of intra-tooth oxygen isotopic change reflects either differences in the spatial location of pastures, differences in the relative contribution of 18O enriched leaf water to caprine body water, or a combination of both. The incorporation of pasturing strategies involving vertical transhumance into livestock management systems, in conjunction with zooarchaeological evidence for increasing pastoral specialization and wool production at K{\"o}{\c s}k H{\"o}y{\"u}k, suggests an intensification of smallstock production that provided important economic support for increasingly complex political landscapes.},

Analysis of serially sampled molars from sympatric wild and domesticated caprines inhabiting the Gobi steppe-desert reveal inter-species distinction in carbon and oxygen isotope ratios as as well as pronounced differences in the amplitude of intra-tooth isotopic change. For domesticated sheep, consistently high {\dh}13C values visible in intra-tooth sequences and 13C enrichment in enamel with a winter season formation period indicates pronounced graze intake throughout the year including receipt of a C4 fodder source during the winter months. This pattern contrasts with low {$\delta$}13C values visible in the teeth of wild caprines indicating the intake of C3 graze and browse throughout the year. Domesticated sheep also demonstrate a wide amplitude of intra-tooth oxygen isotope variation compared to wild caprines in addition to higher summer season maxima {$\delta$}18O values and lower winter season minima {$\delta$}18O values. The greater contribution of graze to the domesticated sheep diet suggests 18O-enriched leaf water strongly influences summer season {$\delta$}18O values, while 18O-depleted groundwater imbibed from wells is likely responsible for low winter season {$\delta$}18O values. The oxygen isotopic distinction between wild and domesticated sheep populations affirm previous observations that the ingestion of isotopically distinct water sources impacts body water oxygen isotopic composition and subsequent expression of {$\delta$}18O values in herbivore tooth carbonates. This has important implications for the use of {$\delta$}18O values obtained from serially sampled teeth for reconstructing paleoenvironment, seasonality and also the movement of wild and domesticated herbivores through modern and ancient landscapes.},

The past two decades of research by Project ArAGATS (the Armenian\textendash{}American collaboration for the Archaeology and Geography of Ancient Transcaucasian Societies) has demonstrated that LBA sovereignty emerged not through the sociopolitical coalescence of settled farming villages, but through the actions of hierarchically organized, mobile pastoralists. Post-processual archaeology helped focus discussions of ancient political life on the contingent nature of authority and the processes through which competing factions and stakeholders achieve political association. However, centuries of interpretive marginalization of nomadic peoples combined with deterministic notions regarding subsistence and settlement practices of mobile pastoralists have, until recently, hindered a broader anthropological consideration of the potential pathways to sovereignty available to more mobile societies. Drawing on a range of datasets from LBA fortresses, shrines, cemeteries, and ephemeral residential complexes, our study examines the essential factors contributing to the emergence and maintenance of complex polities among mobile pastoralists in the southern Caucasus, societies that were intimately associated\textemdash{}politically, economically, and ritually\textemdash{}with hill-top fortresses. This study of political association in LBA Armenia sheds light on the internal politics of nomadic communities and offers a unique opportunity to bring the South Caucasus into the comparitive study of ancient complex polities.},

  abstract = {Paratethys represents the large basin that extended from central Europe to inner Asia, comprising the North Alpine foreland, Pannonian and Dacian basins, the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Connectivity between these subbasins and the connectivity of Paratethys with the open ocean varied drastically because of pervasive tectono-climatic processes affecting the region. Here, we investigate the biogenically produced carbonates of the Dacian basin for strontium analyses to monitor changes in connectivity, water geochemistry and palaeoenvironment during the Mio-Pliocene transition. Diagenetic evaluation showed that not all contamination could be removed, but that the strontium content of our samples was not affected by postdepositional processes. 87Sr/86Sr ratios of ostracods and molluscs are in good agreement and show relatively constant values of 0.70865\textendash{}0.70885. These are much lower than coeval Mio-Pliocene ocean water (0.7089\textendash{}0.7090), which indicates that no long-standing connection existed to the Mediterranean. The newly obtained strontium ratios for Paratethys are best explained by a mixture of Danube, Dnieper and Don river waters, implying connectivity between Dacian basin and Black Sea during the latest Miocene\textendash{}earliest Pliocene. We observed no evidence for connectivity to the Caspian Sea during this period. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of the Dacian basin are similar to the ones measured in the Mediterranean ``Upper Evaporites/Lago Mare'' facies. The major fresh water deluge at the end of the Messinian salinity crisis could thus have been caused by drowning of Eastern Paratethys waters into the Mediterranean.},

  issn = {0009-2541},
  abstract = {Although variation in 87Sr/86Sr has been widely pursued as a tracer of provenance in environmental studies, forensics, archeology and food traceability, accurate methods for mapping variations in environmental 87Sr/86Sr at regional scale are not available. In this paper, we build upon earlier efforts to model 87Sr/86Sr in bedrock by developing GIS-based models for Sr isotopes in rock and water that include the combined effects of lithology and time. Using published data, we fit lithology-specific model parameters for generalized equations describing the concentration of radiogenic Sr in silicate and carbonate rocks. The new model explained more than 50\% of the observed variance in measured Sr isotope values from independent global databases of igneous, metaigneous, and carbonate rocks, but performed more poorly (explaining 33\% of the variance) for sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. In comparison, a previously applied model formulation that did not include lithology-specific parameters explained only 20\% and 8\% of the observed variance for igneous and sedimentary rocks, respectively, and exhibited an inverse relationship with measured carbonate rock values. Building upon the bedrock model, we also developed and applied equations to predict the contribution of different rock types to 87Sr/86Sr variations in water as a function of their weathering rates and strontium content. The resulting water model was compared to data from 68 catchments and shown to give more accurate predictions of stream water 87Sr/86Sr (R2=0.70) than models that did not include lithological weathering parameters. We applied these models to produce maps (``isoscapes'') predicting 87Sr/86Sr in bedrock and water across the contiguous USA, and compared the mapped Sr isotope distributions to data on Sr isotope ratios of US marijuana crops. Although the maps produced here are demonstrably imperfect and leave significant scope for further refinement, they provide an enhanced framework for lithology-based Sr isotope modeling and offer a baseline for provenance studies by constraining the 87Sr/86Sr in strontium sources at regional scales.},

Isotopic data associated with direct radiocarbon dating on bones showed that millet was consumed by animals and humans at the earliest towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (1621-1450 cal BC) in Georgia. These results are in keeping with (1) the numerous direct radiocarbon dates on charred millet seeds and (2) the geomorphological studies showing an increase of better soil quality and cultivable areas during the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods in the Kura valley.},

  abstract = {This paper presents isotope-geochronological and petrological study of granitoids of the potentially ore-bearing (Au\textendash{}As\textendash{}Sb\textendash{}Sn\textendash{}Mo) Early Pliocene Tsana Complex, which are confined to the Main Caucasus fault zone (upthrow fault) in the central part of the Greater Caucasus Range. The Tsurungal and Karobi groups of magmatic bodies are distinguished based on spatial criterion. The Tsurungal group includes three small granite\textemdash{}granodiorite massifs (Tsurungal, Chorokhi, and Toteldash) and numerous acid and intermediate dikes in the upper reaches of the Tskhenistsqali River (Kvemo Svaneti, Georgia). The Karobi group comprises three subvolcanic rhyodacite bodies located in the upper reaches of the Chashuri River (Zemo Racha, Georgia) and numerous N\textendash{}S-trending trachyandesite dikes near the axial zone of the Main Caucasus Range. The K-Ar and Rb-Sr isotope dating shows that the granitoid massifs and dike bodies of the Tsana Complex were formed in two different-age pulses of the Pliocene magmatism: phase I at 4.80 {$\pm$} 0.15 and phase II at 4.15 {$\pm$} 0.10 Ma. All hypabyssal rocks of the Karobi group, unlike those of the Tsurungal Group, were formed during the first pulse. Petrographic studies in combination with geochemical data indicate that most of the granitoids of the Tsana Complex are hybrid rocks (I-type post-collisional granites) and were derived through mixing of deep-seated mantle magmas with acid melts obtained by the upper crustal anatectic melting in the Main Caucasus fault zone. The granitoids of the Tsurungal Group define basic to acid evolution (diorite\textendash{}granodiorite\textendash{}granite\textendash{}two-mica granite) possibly caused by both crystallization differentiation and increasing role of crustal contamination in the petrogenesis of the parental magmas of these rocks. This conclusion is also confirmed by the differences in the Sr isotope composition between granitoids of the early (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7053) and late (87Sr/86Sr = 0.7071) phases of the Tsana Complex. Main trends in spatiotemporal migration of magmatic activity in the central part of the Greater Caucasus in the Pliocene\textendash{}Quaternary time were established using obtained and earlier published isotope-geochronological data.},

  abstract = {This study presents new major and trace element and Sr\textendash{}Nd isotopic results for a suite of Miocene\textendash{}Recent mafic lavas from the Kivu volcanic province in the western branch of the East African Rift. These lavas exhibit a very wide range in chemical and isotopic characteristics, due to a lithospheric mantle source region that is heterogeneous on a small scale, probably {$<$}1 km. The chemical and isotopic variations are mostly geographically controlled: lavas from Tshibinda volcano, which lies on a rift border fault on the northwestern margin of the province, have higher values of 87Sr/86Sr, (La/Sm)n, Ba/Nb, and Zr/Hf than the majority of Kivu (Bukavu) samples. The range of 87Sr/86Sr at Tshibinda (0.70511\textendash{}0.70514) overlaps some compositions found in the neighboring Virunga province, while Bukavu group lavas include the lowest 87Sr/86Sr (0.70314) and highest {$\epsilon$}Nd (+7.6) yet measured in western rift lavas. The Tshibinda compositions trend towards a convergence for Sr\textendash{}Nd\textendash{}Pb isotopic values among western rift lavas. Among Kivu lavas, variations in 143Nd/144Nd correlate with those for certain incompatible trace element ratios (e.g., Th/Nb, Zr/Hf, La/Nb, Ba/Rb), with Tshibinda samples defining one compositional extreme. There are covariations of isotopic and trace element ratios in mafic lavas of the East African Rift system that vary systematically with geographic location. The lavas represent a magmatic sampling of variations in the underlying continental lithospheric mantle, and it appears that a common lithospheric mantle (CLM) source is present beneath much of the East African Rift system. This source contains minor amphibole and phlogopite, probably due to widespread metasomatic events between 500 and 1000 Ma. Lava suites which do not show a strong component of the CLM source, and for which the chemical constraints also suggest the shallowest magma formation depths, are the Bukavu group lavas from Kivu and basanites from Huri Hills, Kenya. The inferred extent of lithospheric erosion therefore appears to be significant only beneath these two areas, which is generally consistent with lithospheric thickness variations estimated from gravity and seismic studies.},

  abstract = {The isotopic geochronology of a representative collection of moderately acidic volcanics from the Dzhavakheti neovolcanic area in the northwest of the Lesser Caucasus (Georgia) is studied using the K\textendash{}Ar and Rb\textendash{}Sr methods. Three discrete stages of the regional volcanic activity took place in that area during the late Miocene (about 8\textendash{}7 Ma), Pliocene (4\textendash{}2 Ma), and Quaternary (800\textendash{}about 50 ka). Moderately acidic volcanic rocks were most characteristic of the first and third stages, whereas basalts with subordinate rhyolite\textendash{}dacitic lavas were typical of the second one. The K\textendash{}Ar dates evidence for intermittent formation of the Dzhavakheti dacites formerly attributed altogether to one Goderdzi Formation. Pyroclastic units and intraformational dacitic flows exposed in the Kura River valley were formed in the late Miocene (7\textendash{}8 Ma). The extrusive domes of the Amiranisgora and Chikiani volcanoes emerged at about 3 Ma. Dacitic lavas of the Dzhavakheti Ridge were erupted probably in the late Pliocene (about 2 Ma). Dacitic volcanism of the Samsari Ridge that commenced at about 800 ka had three discrete phases responsible for the formation of the ``western range'' volcanoes (800\textendash{}700 ka), the Samsari caldera and other volcanoes of the main ridge (300\textendash{}200 ka), and parasitic volcanoes and hyalodacitic lava flows (later than 50 ka). The volcanic activity in the Samsari Ridge continued up to the late Neopleistocene or, probably, to the Holocene. Accordingly, this area of the Dzhavakheti region is potentially hazardous with respect to volcanism reactivation. It was found out that plagioclase phenocrysts of the Dzhavakheti dacitic lavas contain the 40Ar excess and differ in initial Sr and Nd isotopic ratios from the rock groundmass. These peculiarities previously noted for Quaternary lavas in other Caucasian volcanic centers appear to be also characteristic of Pliocene rocks. It is confirmed that the K\textendash{}Ar dating of young volcanics, when applied to their groundmass, yields the most reliable results.},

Results show the strong presence of cereals (especially naked wheat, as a hexaploid form, and emmer), highlighting the role played by cereal growing in the Kura-Araxes farming activities.

While animal dung seems to have been used to enhance cereal yields, different herding practices can be suggested by {$\delta$}15N values.

K-Ar dating showed that young dacitic lavas and pyroclastic rocks were formed in the mid-Pliocene (3.28 {$\pm$} 0.10 Ma) in relation with the explosive\textendash{}effusive eruptions of small composite volcanic cones and formation of minor extrusive domes confined mainly to the eastern margin of the region. Isotope-geochronological data in the combination with results of structural drilling indicate that the considered short-term pulse of the volcanic activity occurred during a short gap between two phases of the Pliocene\textendash{}Early Pleistocene mafic magmatism widespread within the Akhalkalaki plateau. The studied Pliocene dacites were erupted at the post-collisional stage of the evolution of the Lesser Caucasus, but bear petrological-geochemical affinity of adakitic series. They are characterized by the steady presence of amphibole phenocrysts, the elevated contents of Sr, Ba, LILE and the lowered contents of Y, Nb, Ta, and HREE, and have depleted Sr isotopic composition (87Sr/86Sr {$<$} 0.7045). Analysis of petrogenetic models earlier proposed to explain the generation of adakite-like magmas in the modern collision zones showed that the origin of the Pliocene dacitic lavas of the Akhlkalaki plateau is best described by the crystallization differentiation of water-saturated calc-alkaline basaltic melts with removal of common mafic rock-forming minerals (first of all, amphibole and pyroxene) and accessory phases (apatite, titanite, Ti-magnetite) as cumulus minerals. Crustal assimilation of evolved magmas only insignificantly contributed to the petrogenesis of the dacites.},

  abstract = {The southern margin of the Eurasian plate is a well-studied region of continental collision. The Caucasus mountains lie at the centre of the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, and differs from their better studied neighbours by the presence of intense, largely mantle derived post-collisional magmatism. Volcanism began 5-15 Ma after the initial collision occurred, and after the crust had already thickened to 45-60 km. This thesis presents bulk rock and mineral element and isotope geochemistry to assess the role of asthenosphere, lithosphere and crust in generating contemporaneous volcanism across the region. Broad similarities are seen between volcanism in the Greater and Lesser Caucasus, dominated by calc-alkaline basalt-dacite (48-72 wt\% SiO\textsubscript{2}) compositions. High Mg\# cores ({$>$}85) of olivines suggest significant fractionation has occurred. Trace element patterns show a distinctive supra-subduction setting, suggesting the fluid-enriched source remained in place, and hydrated {$>$}10 Ma following collision. Isotope ratios require an asthenospheric component in the early Lesser Caucasus melts, whilst sediment-enrichment of the source is observed across the region. Little interaction with the thickened crust is observed. For the Lesser Caucasus, a model of Palaeo-Tethyan slab breakoff is proposed, resulting in asthenospheric upwelling and melting of an enriched lithosphere. Small-scale convection continues to produce drips, leading to episodic pulses of magmatism. Subduction of back-arc crust with slab breakoff is proposed beneath the Greater Caucasus, allowing melting of enriched lithosphere, with distinguishable  fluid, and slab-melt components. Although contemporaneous, and volcanism in the Lesser and Greater Caucasus being geochemically similar in many respects, a shared source is ruled out because of tectonic constraints. Strike-slip faulting, the result of a tectonic regime shift at 5 Ma, determined the location of volcanoes. Although the style of post-collisional magmatism may not be characteristic of all continental collision zones, where present it has a high preservation potential. It may therefore play a significant role in the formation, and composition of continental crust that is largely unrecognised in models of continental crust evolution.},

  abstract = {The Pliocene\textendash{}Quaternary volcanic rocks of Armenia are a key component of the Arabia\textendash{}Eurasia collision, representing intense magmatism within the Turkish\textendash{}Iranian plateau, tens of millions of years after the onset of continental collision. Here we present whole rock elemental and NdSr isotope data from mafic, intermediate, and felsic lava flows and cinder cones in Shirak and Lori provinces, NW Armenia. Magmatism appears to be controlled locally by extension related to major strike-slip faults within the plateau. Major and trace element results show that the three series\textemdash{}valley-filling medium-K alkali basalt flows, ridge-forming andesite to rhyolite flows, and andesitic cinder cones\textemdash{}form a compositional continuum linked by a crystallisation sequence dominated by two pyroxenes, plagioclase and amphibole. There is petrographic and major and trace element evidence for magma mixing processes and potentially crustal contamination by Mesozoic\textendash{}early Cenozoic arc-related rocks, which has not significantly affected the isotopic signature. Modelling of the basaltic rocks indicates that they formed by moderate degrees of partial melting (\textasciitilde{}3\textendash{}4\%) of an incompatible element enriched, subduction-modified, lithospheric mantle source. Samples have a distinctive high Zr/Hf ratio and high Zr concentrations, which are an intrinsic part of the source or the melting process, and are much more commonly found in ocean island basalts. Regional models for magmatism often argue for whole-scale delamination of the mantle lithosphere beneath Eastern Anatolia and the Lesser Caucasus, but this scenario is hard to reconcile with limited crustal signatures and the apparent lack of asthenospheric components within many studied centres.},
